# DeepLearningProject

Image Classification of different types of birds based on the kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species?select=birds.csv.

The project uses a pretrained model EfficientNetB0 and a dense network.

The model has produced a very low accuracy currently.
